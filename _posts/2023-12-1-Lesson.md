    <h1>Basics of Animation</h1>
    <p>
        Below is a sprite of Mr. Lopez. This was the first sprite created for his spritesheet, which outlines the animation of his movement frame by frame.

        Below is the spritesheet of Mr. Lopez. Each row has a different side of him, because in the project that we used this in, he was able to move freely in all 4 directions. His animation is simple, and depicts basic movement.

    <p>
        The most recent changes made to the spritesheet was the addition of his cane. In our OOP game, we plan to have the player utilize Mr. Lopez's cane as a weapon. Our next step in animation will be drawing new sprites for the player's attacks.
